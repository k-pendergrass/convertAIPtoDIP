# convertAIPtoDIP
Script to convert an Archival Information Package (AIP) organized as a BagIt bag into a Dissemination Information Package (DIP) by validating the bag, optionally deleting files according to two manifests, removing the BagIt metadata files, removing empty directories, adding a README file for users, and renaming the AIP directory with the DIP name.
